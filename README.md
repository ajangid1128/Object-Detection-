# Object-Detection (YOLOv4)

1. Bounding Box (Creating Labels/Annotations)- 
* The Json file of annotation does not contain the bounding box coordinate
* Creating manually the bounding box on image dataset using *LabelImg* (**github.com/tzutalin/labelImg**) Tool -- tooks to much time to build bounding box around each image. 

2. Downloading annotated images from huge dataset.
Downloaded anotated and labelled dataset (containing bounding box values) from google open images dataset. 

3. Converting images in yolo format

4. Make Data ready for training purposes 

4. Training on COCO Dataset (80 Classes)

5. Training on Custom Dataset (with only Person-Car Class)
