# Object-Detection (YOLOv4)

1. **Bounding Box** (Creating Labels/Annotations)- 
* The Json file of annotation does not contain the bounding box coordinate
* Created manually the bounding box on image dataset using **LabelImg** Tool https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg -- tooks to much time to build bounding box around each image.

2. **Downloaded annotated images** from huge dataset.
* Downloaded anotated and labelled dataset (containing bounding box values) from google open images dataset with Person & Car class.
* Category = [Person, Car]
* Clone the repo - https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit to download dataset (Dataset) and annotation (csv_folder) from open image dataset.

3. Converting images in yolo format
* Generate file that contain class and bounding box info along with image dataset. 
* Obtained CenterX, CenterY, width, height of bounding box and store in txt file.
* Format for yolo = Each Image + Each Annotation [classnumber,CenterX, CenterY, width, height]  

4. Training on COCO Dataset (80 Classes)
* Clone the repo: https://github.com/alexeyab/darknet
* Download weights trained on Coco Dataset

* Used Google Colab GPU hardware system
* Compile our darknet model - open source neural network model.

5. Training on Custom Dataset (with only Person-Car Class)
